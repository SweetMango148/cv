  <h1><strong>About me</strong></h1>
  <P>Hello, my name is NemmiOnline, and I'm currently a student and a part-time Roblox Youtuber! My sister and I(usually) post videos weekly playing Roblox. Recently, ahem, we've been posting some dance covers to some of the songs we think are a BOP,
    and please expect many more dance covers!!!</P>
  <h1><strong>My Sister</strong></h1>
  <p>My sister AKA Naminarii is the other person you see on my dance covers. She and I work both together to create the choreography and choose the song. Unlike me, she has better music taste(in my opinion), so I often scroll through her Spotify to
    get some ✨inspiration✨. </p>
